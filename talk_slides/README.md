Title: Random Graph Models of a neocortical column in a rat's brain and their topological statistical distributions

Abstract: There has been work done over the years to understand what exactly are the driving forces behind how the brain functions. Recently, with the advent of cloud computing and being able to store large volumes of data, reconstructing neocortical columns from the brain has become not only possible, but much easier. The Blue Brain Project (BBP) created multiple digital reconstructions of a rat's neocortical microcircuitry that closely resembles the biological features that include the numbers, types and densities of neurons and their synaptic connectivity that followed anatomical and physiological data obtained from experiments. What followed were sets of microconnectomes that were represented as directed graphs. After applying a stimulus to the microconnectomes, realisations of connectivity were observed. One of these observations has been identified as the BioM microconnectome. To determine the complexity of the BioM microconnectome, we use topological statistics to specify this complexity on the local level as well as the global level. We study here, five models, each with an added level of complexity ranging from the simplest random graph of Erdos-Renyi to those that account for known biological characteristics such as distance dependence and neocortical layers. We found that our models lacked volume in complexity on the local level but found surprisingly higher levels of connectivity on the global level than first expected.
